    "Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a technique used to fine-tune models in the field of reinforcement learning. This method aims to improve the stability and efficiency of the training process by keeping policy updates within a certain range. PPO achieves this by introducing a constraint on policy changes to ensure that new policies do not deviate too far from the old policies. This results in a more stable and efficient training process, enhancing the model's performance.\n",
    "Steps to Apply PPO to an LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to train your SFT model (Supervised Fine-tuning Trainer), to ensure the data we train on is in-distribution for the PPO algorithm. In addition we need to train a Reward model which will be used to optimize the SFT model using the PPO algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Rollout: The language model generates a response or continuation based on query which could be the start of a sentence.\n",
    " 2. Evaluation: The query and response are evaluated with a function, model, human feedback or some combination of them. The important thing is that this process should yield a scalar value for each query/response pair.\n",
    " 3. Optimization: This is the most complex part. In the optimisation step the query/response pairs are used to calculate the log-probabilities of the tokens in the sequences. This is done with the model that is trained and a reference model, which is usually the pre-trained model before fine-tuning. The KL-divergence between the two outputs is used as an additional reward signal to make sure the generated responses don’t deviate too far from the reference language model. The active language model is then trained with PPO."
